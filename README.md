# Reaction Time Task Example

An example of a reaction time task in [Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/). 

This example demonstrates how to use the [Harp Hobgoblin](https://harp-tech.org/tutorials/hobgoblin-setup.html) to implement a simple task that can be adapted to model a wide range of neuroscience experiments. For a detailed walkthrough on the task logic, refer to this [tutorial](https://harp-tech.org/tutorials/hobgoblin-reaction.html).
